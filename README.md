# Detecting Cycles in Graphs

Kruskal's Algorithm adds edges to the minimum spanning tree, unless they would
add a cycle. In the lectures, we did not talk about how to do this -- you're
going to implement a function to detect cycles in a graph. Start with the
template I provided in `code.js`. You can use any data structures (i.e. any
graph representation) you like. The function should return `true` or `false`,
depending on whether the given graph contains a cycle or not.

I have not provided any test code; you can base yours on test code from other
exercises.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case big $\Theta$ complexity of your implementation? Add your
answer, including your reasoning, to this markdown file.

- the worst case complexity is when we have to search for a path at every node and never find a path (i.e. there are no cycles). This means we will have to search $V$ times and call the search function whose time complexity is $O(V + E)

- therefore, our worst cases time complexity of this algorithm is $O(V * (V + E))$ which simplifies to $O(V^2 + (V * E))
